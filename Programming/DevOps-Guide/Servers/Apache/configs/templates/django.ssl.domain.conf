# When you use daemon mode, the number of processes and threads is static. This is one of the immediate benefits of using daemon mode. 
# Specifically, that process management is more predictable. One of the big problems with using embedded mode is that Apache can decide to create additional processes or kill off existing ones. 
# For a web application with large startup costs this is not a good idea as you could suddenly see increased CPU usage due to more processes being started right at the time you don't need it such as when a throughput spike occurs. 
# This can actually cause performance to degrade in the short term rather than improve.
